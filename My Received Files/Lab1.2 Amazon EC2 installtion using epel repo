Installation on Amazon linux
===========================================
Ansible is not part of the amazon repo so we have to install the epel repo to download ansible and install in ec2 instance. Alternatively, we can use pip install ansible 


yum update
yum install wget

	wget -r --no-parent -A 'epel-release-*.rpm' http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/
rpm -Uvh dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-*.rpm
	ls -l /etc/yum.repos.d/
yum install epel-release
yum install ansible
