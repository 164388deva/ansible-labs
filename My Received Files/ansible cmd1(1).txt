Steps to install and configure Ansible 
========================================

Launch 2 EC2 instances in the same VPC (same subnet or differnt subnet will be fine but same vpc) 
Tag one instance as master and the other as client

For RHEL 7
==============
1. wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

For Rhel 6
===============

yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm 

rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum --enablerepo=epel install ansible

2. Create entries for your clients in the /etc/hosts file 

vi /etc/hosts 
<private ip of master > <name of the master> 
<private ip of the client> < name of the client> 

esc :wq! 


3. Allow password less authentication from master to client

a) in the ansible client system, open the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config , and change the value of "PasswordAuthentication no" to 

"PasswordAuthentication yes". 

also set the value "PermitRootLogin no"

to "PermitRootLogin yes"
Save the file and exits 

#service sshd restart 

Then, set a password for the root user. run the passwd command as root 

#passwd 


b) In the ansible master server run the below command to create the ssh keys ( In this example we are using root account only) 

#ssh-keygen (select default values) 

This command will create the ssh key pair for the root user


c) from the master server try to ssh into the client server 

#ssh root@<private ip of the client> 

it should ask for the password 

d) Run the command to set the password less authentication. 

#ssh-copy-id -i root@<client IP> 

if the command is successfull, ssh will not ask for the password next time. 


4. Set the /etc/ansible/hosts file with the correct entry of all the client servers.

5. That's it. Ansible is ready to be used. Try the below commands 


ansible all -m ping
ansible all -m shell "uname -a"
ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"
ansible all -m shell -a "/sbin/service httpd start"
